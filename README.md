This is a module for Foundry Virtual Tabletop that adds labels to the scene grid.

This module is a WIP, and I may or may not ever complete it. If you are a module developer and would like to use my work as the basis for a more complete module providing this functionality, feel free to do so (just follow the license, and give your module it's own name so it doesn't conflict with mine in case I finish it). If you finish and release a module with this functionality, let me know and I will link to it here.
